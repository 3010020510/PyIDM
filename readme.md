# How to install pyIDM?
You have 3 options to run pyIDM on your operating system:
1. **pip**:<br>
    `pip install pyIDM`
    
    then you can run application from Terminal by:<br>
    `python -m pyidm`          note pyidm pkg name in small letters 

    or just<br>
    `pyIDM`        where pyIDM.py is script located at "python/scripts", if it doesn't work append "python/scripts" folder to PATH. 

2. **Binary executables**:<br>
currently binary build "Standalone zip" is available only for windows [here](https://github.com/pyIDM/pyIDM/releases/latest).

3. **run from github source code**:<br>
pyIDM is a python app. so, it can run on any platform that can run python, 
To run from source, you have to have a python installed, "supported python versions is 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8", then download or clone this repository, and run pyIDM.py (it will install the other required python packages automatically if missing)
if pyIDM failed to install required packages, you should install it manually, refer to "Dependencies" section below.

---

# Dependencies:
below are the requirements to run from source:
- Python 3.6+: tested with python 3.6 on windows, and 3.7, 3.8 on linux
- [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) : for merging audio with youtube DASH videos "it will be installed automatically on windows"

Required python packages: 
- [pycurl](http://pycurl.io/docs/latest/index.html): is a Python interface to libcurl / curl as our download engine,
- [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI): a beautiful gui builder, 
- [youtube_dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl): famous youtube downloader, limited use for meta information extraction only but videos are downloaded using pycurl 
- certifi: required by 'pycurl' for validating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates,
- pyperclip: A cross-platform clipboard module for monitoring url copied to clipboard, requires "xclip or xsel to be available on linux"
- plyer: for systray area notification.


** please read notes below


pyIDM application will do its best to install missing packages automatically once you run it. or you can install required packages manually using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```
python -m pip install --user --upgrade certifi PySimpleGUI pyperclip plyer youtube_dl pycurl
```

# Why another download manager?:
With all free and paid download manager why someone may need another one?
I believe in one term, **"if the product is free, then you are the product"**, most (if not all) free applications collect data about you, some of them are toxic and plant trojans and spyware in your system, then I decided to make my own download manager based on python with ðŸ‘‰ **"--GUI--"** relies only on open source tools and libraries, nothing hidden, with source code exposed to thousands of programmers, no one can play dirty games here ðŸ˜‰.

### note for pycurl: <br>
for windows users:
normal pip install i.e `python -m pip install pycurl` might fail on windows because you need to build libcurl on your system first which is a headache. 
your best choice if pip fail is to download exe file for pycurl from its official download [link](https://dl.bintray.com/pycurl/pycurl/), find the file that match your windows system and python version installed on your system, last checked on 28-01-2020, found available files for almost all Python versions upto version 3.7

example: if you have python 3.6 installed on windows 32bit, you should download "pycurl-7.43.0.2.win32-py3.6.exe" file and install it, 
another example: if you have python 3.7 running on windows 64 bit, you should choose and download "pycurl-7.43.0.3.win-amd64-py3.7.exe" file

other download options include a wheel, zip file, or even a windows installer

for linux users:
there is no issues, since most linux distros have curl preinstalled, so pycurl will link with libcurl library to get built with no issues, checked with python versions 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8 working with no problems.
<br>


### note for [Youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl): <br>
youtube website changes frequently, if this application failed to retrieve video/playlist data
you should update youtube-dl module thru pyIDM setting tab or manually by
```
python -m pip install youtube_dl --upgrade
```

### note for pyperclip: <br>
Pyperclip is a cross-platform Python module for copy and paste clipboard functions. it is being used if you want to monitor clipboard for files urls and it will be processed automatically by the application.
On Linux, this module makes use of the xclip or xsel commands, which should come with the os. Otherwise run "sudo apt-get install xclip" on Debian like or "sudo pacman -S xclip" on archlinux

---

### Windows binaries: <br>
a standalone frozen version prepared by py2exe or cx_freeze is available on: [latest version](https://github.com/pyIDM/pyIDM/releases/latest) <br>
for all available build versions you can check https://github.com/pyIDM/pyIDM/releases

### How does pyIDM work??
- once you copy any url in clipboard the application start processing this url automatically "you can disable this in user setting"
- pycurl get url headers and follow redirections to get the effective download url.
- headers get processed and data get extracted and create a download_item object 
containing attributes like name, size, url, etc... for the target file
- update gui accordingly.
- if user click start download button, the download_item object added to download queue.
- depending on user setting objects in download queue get prcessed concurrently
- each download object will be passed to a brain function
- brain function will prepare a segment list or parts list " file will be downloaded in chunks concurrently" for 
example a 100MB file will be splitted into 100 parts with part size of 1MB each, each part will be downloaded 
separately in a dedicated thread, Number of threads, and part size can be changed in user setting.
- brain will start a thread manager to make a worker thread for each file segment / part.
- brain will start file manager to collect segments and write it to a temp file, in same time write completed 
segments names in a file for resume later function.
- Thread manager will report operation completed to brain once finished downloading all file segments
- brain will order both thread manager and file manager to quit and report completed download to main window, then quit
- and so on for all downloads
- example if you have a 3 concurrent downloads with 10 concurrent connections for each download you will have 30 running threads 
concurrently.
- communications between threads based heavily on queues which shows best fit for this job.
- some websites doesn't support range requests, so downloads will not be resumable nor multi-connection will be available.
- 
- for youtube video url, a youtube_dl module starts in a separate threads to get playlist videos and available streams for each video
- video streams are three types (normal videos, video only, audio only) if user decided to download a video only stream, the application
will choose an audio stream with the same format, then download both streams as explained above (by brain function) then once completed
the audio will be merged into video file using FFMPEG external application "subprocess".
